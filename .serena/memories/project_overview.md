# Drawing Library Project Overview

## Purpose
A Python drawing application data model library built with Pydantic for vector graphics. The library provides a comprehensive foundation for drawing applications using a component-based design pattern.

## Key Features
- **Component-based architecture** for maximum flexibility
- **Pydantic models** for validation and JSON serialization
- **Comprehensive styling system** with colors, gradients, fills, strokes, and effects
- **Type-safe enums** for shape types, blend modes, line caps/joins, etc.
- **Full Python 3.12 support** with modern type hints

## Current Implementation Status
Based on git history, the project has:
1. ✅ Initial project setup with Python environment and dependencies
2. ✅ Core type system with enums and validators
3. ✅ Comprehensive styling system with colors, fills, strokes, and effects

## Still Needed (based on PRD)
- Shape models implementation
- Layer management system
- Transform system
- Drawing document model
- Performance benchmarks
