# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement performance benchmarking system with pytest-benchmark for tracking library performance across different operations and dataset sizes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a comprehensive performance benchmarking suite using pytest-benchmark to measure and track the performance of drawing library operations including shape creation, rendering, layer management, and document serialization across various dataset sizes.
# Details:
This task involves creating a performance benchmarking system:

1. **Benchmark Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Install pytest-benchmark as a development dependency
   - Create `tests/test_benchmarks.py` for all benchmark tests
   - Configure pytest-benchmark settings for consistent measurements
   - Set up performance baseline tracking

2. **Shape Creation Benchmarks**:
   - Benchmark individual shape creation (Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, Polygon, Path)
   - Test bulk shape creation (100, 1000, 10000 shapes)
   - Measure shape property modification performance
   - Compare creation time for shapes with different complexity levels

3. **Styling System Benchmarks**:
   - Benchmark Color creation and validation (hex, rgb, rgba formats)
   - Measure Fill and Stroke creation with various properties
   - Test Effect application performance (shadow, blur, glow)
   - Benchmark style inheritance and propagation

4. **Layer Management Benchmarks**:
   - Test layer creation and deletion performance
   - Benchmark layer reordering operations
   - Measure performance of visibility toggling
   - Test blend mode calculations with multiple layers

5. **Document Operations Benchmarks**:
   - Benchmark document creation with varying complexity
   - Test serialization performance (to_dict) for different document sizes
   - Measure deserialization performance (from_dict)
   - Compare performance with different numbers of layers and shapes

6. **Rendering Pipeline Benchmarks**:
   - Benchmark shape rendering to different formats
   - Test layer composition performance
   - Measure bounding box calculations
   - Profile memory usage during rendering

7. **Scalability Tests**:
   - Create benchmarks with datasets of varying sizes:
     - Small: 10-100 shapes
     - Medium: 100-1000 shapes
     - Large: 1000-10000 shapes
     - Extra Large: 10000+ shapes
   - Test performance degradation patterns

8. **Performance Reporting**:
   - Generate performance reports in multiple formats (JSON, HTML)
   - Create performance trends visualization
   - Set up performance regression detection
   - Document performance characteristics and optimization opportunities

# Test Strategy:
1. **Benchmark Validation**:
   - Verify all benchmark tests run successfully with pytest-benchmark
   - Ensure benchmarks produce consistent results across multiple runs
   - Validate that performance measurements are accurate and meaningful

2. **Coverage Testing**:
   - Confirm all major operations have corresponding benchmarks
   - Check that different dataset sizes are properly tested
   - Verify memory profiling is working correctly

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Run benchmarks before and after code changes
   - Set up automated performance regression detection
   - Compare results against established baselines

4. **Report Generation**:
   - Test that performance reports are generated correctly
   - Verify HTML and JSON output formats
   - Check that performance trends are accurately tracked

5. **Integration with CI/CD**:
   - Ensure benchmarks can run in CI environment
   - Verify performance thresholds trigger appropriate warnings
   - Test that benchmark results are properly archived
