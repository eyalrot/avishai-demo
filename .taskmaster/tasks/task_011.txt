# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create comprehensive example applications demonstrating the library with basic shapes, logo design, and data visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop three example applications that showcase the drawing library's capabilities: a basic shapes demo, a logo design tool, and a data visualization example to demonstrate practical usage patterns.
# Details:
This task involves creating three distinct example applications:

1. **Basic Shapes Demo** (`examples/basic-shapes.py`):
   - Demonstrate creation of all shape types (Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, Polygon, Path)
   - Show various styling options (colors, fills, strokes, effects)
   - Include examples of shape transformations and positioning
   - Display shapes on multiple layers with different blend modes
   - Export to different formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)

2. **Logo Design Tool** (`examples/logo-designer.py`):
   - Create a simple interactive logo design application
   - Implement a company logo using combinations of shapes
   - Demonstrate advanced styling with gradients and shadows
   - Show text integration with custom fonts
   - Include examples of shape composition and grouping
   - Implement logo variations (light/dark mode)
   - Export logo in multiple sizes and formats

3. **Data Visualization Example** (`examples/data-viz.py`):
   - Create charts using the drawing library (bar chart, pie chart, line graph)
   - Demonstrate dynamic shape generation based on data
   - Implement interactive elements (hover effects, tooltips)
   - Show data-driven styling (colors based on values)
   - Include legends and axis labels
   - Export visualizations as static images or interactive SVGs

4. **Common Utilities** (`examples/utils.py`):
   - Helper functions for common patterns
   - Color palette generators
   - Layout utilities (grid, alignment)
   - Animation helpers for SVG export

5. **Documentation**:
   - README.md for examples directory
   - Inline comments explaining key concepts
   - Usage instructions for each example
   - Requirements and setup guide

# Test Strategy:
1. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Run each example application and verify it executes without errors
   - Check that all demonstrated features work as intended
   - Verify exported files are valid and render correctly

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure examples follow library best practices
   - Verify all imports and dependencies are correct
   - Check for proper error handling in examples

3. **Documentation Testing**:
   - Follow setup instructions to ensure they work
   - Verify code comments are clear and helpful
   - Test that examples can be modified easily

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Ensure examples run efficiently
   - Test with larger datasets for data visualization
   - Verify memory usage is reasonable

5. **Cross-platform Testing**:
   - Run examples on different operating systems
   - Test different Python versions (3.8+)
   - Verify output formats work across platforms
