# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create comprehensive documentation including API reference, developer guide, examples documentation, and project README
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop complete documentation suite for the drawing library including an API reference documenting all modules and classes, a developer guide with architectural overview and usage patterns, examples documentation, and a comprehensive project README.
# Details:
This task involves creating four major documentation components:

1. **API Reference** (`API_REFERENCE.md`):
   - Document all public classes, methods, and properties from core modules
   - Include type signatures, parameters, return values, and usage examples
   - Cover core.py (enums, validators), style.py (Color, Fill, Stroke, Effect), shapes.py (all shape classes), layers.py (Layer, LayerManager), document.py (Document)
   - Use consistent documentation format with clear sections for each module
   - Include code examples for each major class and method

2. **Developer Guide** (`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`):
   - Provide architectural overview of the library structure
   - Explain design decisions and patterns used
   - Document the validation system and how to extend it
   - Include workflow guides for common tasks (creating shapes, managing layers, applying styles)
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Document best practices and performance considerations

3. **Examples Documentation** (`examples/README.md`):
   - Create detailed documentation for each example application
   - Explain the concepts demonstrated in basic-shapes.py
   - Document the logo design tool features and usage
   - Describe data visualization example patterns
   - Include screenshots or ASCII diagrams where helpful
   - Add "Getting Started" section for running examples

4. **Project README** (`README.md`):
   - Create main project documentation with installation instructions
   - Include quick start guide with minimal working example
   - Add features list highlighting key capabilities
   - Document system requirements and dependencies
   - Include links to API reference, developer guide, and examples
   - Add contribution guidelines and license information
   - Include badges for version, license, and other relevant metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. **Documentation Completeness**:
   - Verify all public APIs are documented in the API reference
   - Check that every class, method, and significant property has documentation
   - Ensure all code examples in documentation are syntactically correct
   - Validate that examples can be copy-pasted and run successfully

2. **Documentation Quality**:
   - Review for clarity, grammar, and technical accuracy
   - Ensure consistent formatting and structure across all documents
   - Verify internal links between documents work correctly
   - Check that terminology is used consistently throughout

3. **Example Code Validation**:
   - Test all code snippets in documentation to ensure they work
   - Verify import statements are correct and complete
   - Check that examples demonstrate best practices

4. **User Journey Testing**:
   - Follow the README quick start guide as a new user
   - Ensure the developer guide provides clear path for common tasks
   - Verify examples documentation helps understand the library capabilities
   - Check that API reference serves as effective lookup resource
